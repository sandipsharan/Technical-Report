# CONTROLS PROJECT - 1 (119340196 & 119112397)
# A TECHNICAL REPORT ON COORDINATED MANIPULATOR/SPACECRAFT MOTION CONTROL FOR SPACE ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

## _1. Installation of Dependencies_

* To run the simulation, download MATLAB from 

````
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html
````
While installation of the software, check the required toolboxes for installation. The most important tool is Simulink

* Then download the given zip file
````
119340196_proj1.zip
````

## _2. To run the code_

First import all the required data which is named as files in the zip file provided. 

* A matlab file named as ````Variables```` present in the folder is the required workspace which contains all the varibles data needed for simulation
* Then open the simulation file (.slx file) which is named as ````Controls_Simulation````
* Load the code required for plotting the graph 
````
Plotting_code_1
Plotting_code_2
````

* Here Plotting_code_1 is used for plotting the first graph between Spacecraft's position and orientation with respect to time

* Here Plotting_code_2 is used for plotting the first graph between Spacecraft's thruster forces with respect to time

* After importing all the required data click run in the simulink file or press " Ctrl + T "

## _3. Output_

After executing the simulink model, there will a plot poping up which looks similar to:
